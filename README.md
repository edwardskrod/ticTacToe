ticTacToe
=========

This is a simple, command-line, Tic Tac Toe game I created in my first semester of programming.  I had very little knowledge of AI but added some capabilities so that a player can engage the computer.   The AI turned out to be very tough!  Try to beat it!

To use the program, simply download the makefile and 	skrod_ticTacToe.cpp.  Place them in the same directory.  In the command-line, navigate to the directory in which they reside and type "make" (on a Unix machine).  

To run the program, simply type the name of the executable (usually a.out).
